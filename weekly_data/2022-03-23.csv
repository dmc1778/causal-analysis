It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.

What this contains over the free version:
● Unlimited open tabs
● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file

● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.

● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.

● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.

● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

- Made copy link action available in incognito mode.<br>- Fixed bug with bookmark and tab drawer transparency.<br>- Added feature to freeze old tabs until they are accessed if the app restarts.<br>- Added button to search suggestions layout that inserts the suggestion rather than searching for it.<br>- Added support for full sandboxed incognito mode on Android Pie (API 28) and up.<br>- Fixed bug with ad blocker.,"Jan 28, 2013",5.1.0,Lightning Browser Plus - Web Browser,"Lightning Browser Plus is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.

What this contains over the free version:
● Unlimited open tabs
● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file

● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.

● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.

● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.

● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.

What this contains over the free version:
● Unlimited open tabs
● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file

● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.

● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.

It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.

What this contains over the free version:
● Unlimited open tabs
● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file

● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.

● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.

● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.

● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.

● Open-source - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.

- Made copy link action available in incognito mode.<br>- Fixed bug with bookmark and tab drawer transparency.<br>- Added feature to freeze old tabs until they are accessed if the app restarts.<br>- Added button to search suggestions layout that inserts the suggestion rather than searching for it.<br>- Added support for full sandboxed incognito mode on Android Pie (API 28) and up.<br>- Fixed bug with ad blocker.,"Jan 28, 2013",5.1.0,Lightning Browser Plus - Web Browser,"Lightning Browser Plus is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.

What this contains over the free version:
● Unlimited open tabs
● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file

● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.

● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.

● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.

This application will provide information about almost all currently plugged-in USB device (see below for more info about the 'almost'). 

Information includes:
•The Device class
•The USB device path
•The Vendor ID (VID) and the Product ID (PID).
•A List of all interfaces and their endpoints.

If you download the accompanying databases, the application will also be able to provide you with additional info such as the Vendor of the device (which is not necessarily the brand!), the vendor's logo and the product name.

This application uses two different methods to collect information:

1. Android mode will use the native android USB API.
2. Linux mode will parse /sys/bus/usb/devices/.

Each mode (Android/Linux) will provide slightly different information. For example Android mode will give you more information about a device's endpoints and interfaces, while Linux mode will give more information about the device itself (serial number, how it identifies itself, etc.)

Device Subclass resolution will be added in the next version.

I wrote this application as an exercise to explore fragments and the new USB host API. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

This application uses two different methods to collect information:

1. Android mode will use the native android USB API.
2. Linux mode will parse /sys/bus/usb/devices/.

Each mode (Android/Linux) will provide slightly different information. For example Android mode will give you more information about a device's endpoints and interfaces, while Linux mode will give more information about the device itself (serial number, how it identifies itself, etc.)

Device Subclass resolution will be added in the next version.

I wrote this application as an exercise to explore fragments and the new USB host API. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

This application will provide information about almost all currently plugged-in USB device (see below for more info about the 'almost'). 

Information includes:
•The Device class
•The USB device path
•The Vendor ID (VID) and the Product ID (PID).
•A List of all interfaces and their endpoints.

If you download the accompanying databases, the application will also be able to provide you with additional info such as the Vendor of the device (which is not necessarily the brand!), the vendor's logo and the product name.

This application uses two different methods to collect information:

1. Android mode will use the native android USB API.
2. Linux mode will parse /sys/bus/usb/devices/.

Each mode (Android/Linux) will provide slightly different information. For example Android mode will give you more information about a device's endpoints and interfaces, while Linux mode will give more information about the device itself (serial number, how it identifies itself, etc.)

Device Subclass resolution will be added in the next version.

I wrote this application as an exercise to explore fragments and the new USB host API. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

"v2.0.1 Switched to HTTPS, now using internal storage instead of external.","Sep 17, 2011",Varies with device,USB Device Info,"Android 3.1 introduced USB hostmode which allows the user to plug USB devices to your Android tablet in the same way as a Desktop PC and extend its functionality (if the tablet has the correct drivers of course).

This application will provide information about almost all currently plugged-in USB device (see below for more info about the 'almost'). 

Information includes:
•The Device class
•The USB device path
•The Vendor ID (VID) and the Product ID (PID).
•A List of all interfaces and their endpoints.

If you download the accompanying databases, the application will also be able to provide you with additional info such as the Vendor of the device (which is not necessarily the brand!), the vendor's logo and the product name.

This application uses two different methods to collect information:

1. Android mode will use the native android USB API.
2. Linux mode will parse /sys/bus/usb/devices/.

Each mode (Android/Linux) will provide slightly different information. For example Android mode will give you more information about a device's endpoints and interfaces, while Linux mode will give more information about the device itself (serial number, how it identifies itself, etc.)

Device Subclass resolution will be added in the next version.

I wrote this application as an exercise to explore fragments and the new USB host API. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

Each mode (Android/Linux) will provide slightly different information. For example Android mode will give you more information about a device's endpoints and interfaces, while Linux mode will give more information about the device itself (serial number, how it identifies itself, etc.)

Device Subclass resolution will be added in the next version.

I wrote this application as an exercise to explore fragments and the new USB host API. Hopefully it will be useful to someone else.

The QR code should be recognized by most barcode scanner applications (i.e. Barcode Scanner by ZXing) and the NFC tag is formatted in the same way as Android does since it introduced its ""Write to NFC tag"" option in Lollipop. That means people running Android 5.0+ won't have to download any specific app to connect to the network after scanning the tag.

You can also send Wi-Fi configuration via Android Beam: while on a Wi-Fi network screen, tap your device to your friend's device and a pop-up will appear asking if they want to connect.

Important note

Android does not let apps read the saved Wi-Fi passwords, so you will need to enter them manually for each network you want to share. However, the passwords will automatically be retrieved if WiFiKeyShare is given root access.

The QR code should be recognized by most barcode scanner applications (i.e. Barcode Scanner by ZXing) and the NFC tag is formatted in the same way as Android does since it introduced its ""Write to NFC tag"" option in Lollipop. That means people running Android 5.0+ won't have to download any specific app to connect to the network after scanning the tag.

You can also send Wi-Fi configuration via Android Beam: while on a Wi-Fi network screen, tap your device to your friend's device and a pop-up will appear asking if they want to connect.

Important note

Android does not let apps read the saved Wi-Fi passwords, so you will need to enter them manually for each network you want to share. However, the passwords will automatically be retrieved if WiFiKeyShare is given root access.

"Mainly an Android 11 update, for version history see https://brouter.de/brouter/revisions.html ","Mar 24, 2014",1.6.3,BRouter Offline Navigation,"Configurable, elevation-aware (bike-) Router for OFFLINE Navigation based on open data. Works in conjunction with a Map Application.

BRouter does only the plain route-calculation and does not display a map or the calculated route on it's own and therefore works only together with a Map Application. There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory. 

Some popular map apps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.

The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.

The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter's concept of fully configurable routing profiles get's the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: 

car-fast -> car-test
car-short -> moped
bike-fast -> fastbike
bike-short -> trekking

This mapping, however, can by changed anytime via the ""Server-Mode"" Button of the BRouter App. But also the routing profile definitions can be changed or new ones can be created.

BRouter does only the plain route-calculation and does not display a map or the calculated route on it's own and therefore works only together with a Map Application. There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory. 

Some popular map apps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.

The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.

The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter's concept of fully configurable routing profiles get's the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: 

car-fast -> car-test
car-short -> moped
bike-fast -> fastbike
bike-short -> trekking

There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory. 

Some popular map apps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.

The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.

The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter's concept of fully configurable routing profiles get's the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: 

car-fast -> car-test
car-short -> moped
bike-fast -> fastbike
bike-short -> trekking

The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory. 

Some popular map apps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.

The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.

Some popular map apps support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.

The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it's use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the ""Server-Mode"" Button. This feature is called ""timeout-free recalculations"". 

The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. ""nogo200""  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.

BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.

The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter's concept of fully configurable routing profiles get's the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: 

car-fast -> car-test
car-short -> moped
bike-fast -> fastbike
bike-short -> trekking
foot-fast -> shortest

This mapping, however, can by changed anytime via the ""Server-Mode"" Button of the BRouter App. But also the routing profile definitions can be changed or new ones can be created.

BRouter does only the plain route-calculation and does not display a map or the calculated route on it's own and therefore works only together with a Map Application. There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application's waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application's tracks directory.
